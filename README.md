# underscore/emphasize
The functions found in my emphasize.js file are my version or underscore/lodash. They can be viewed and implemented in a similar way to the above mentioned libraries.

If you would like to view/use the code locally first you will need to have the current version of node v6.11.3 is the version I am currently running.

Double check you have this installed by running ``node -v`` in your terminal.

You can always download the latest version <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.

Follow these steps to set up this project locally:

`git clone https://github.com/dasp24/emphasize_methods.git`

`cd emphasize_methods`

`npm install`


## Running tests

if you would like to run the tests I have used to test functionality please do ``npm test``.

All my tests have been done using mocha and chai.

I have extensively tested all the functions listed below, however if you spot any errors or even see a good refactor please let me know.
